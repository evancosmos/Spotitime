# Spotitime - Set a musical timer

Want to set a timer you can activily hear? Something you can jam out to? Spotitime takes a time and automatically creates a playlist on your account of that exact duration! 

By default the music is randomly picked from all music in your spotify account region, however you can select options to choose from your library, or to choose using spotify's hipster search (10% least listened to music). There is also an option to queue the music directly instead of making a playlist.
